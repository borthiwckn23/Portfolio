          <header><h2>Who Am I?</h2></header>
          <p> My name is<em> Nayongi Borthwick</em>. I graduated from Mayfield High School in 2019, and I am currently a second year student at Washington and Lee University. I am a Studio Art and French double major with a minor in Digital Culture and Information. I have done commission work for Mayfield City School District and a few clubs at Washington and Lee University. I am a world traveling artist that has visted 52 countries. Since I have moved a few times and traveled abundantly, I don't consider one place my home. To me, home is anywhere I choose and because of that everywhere I have visted has impacted my art deeply. My offical artist statement is below.</p>

          <p> 
            As an artist, I have grown substantially over the years. At first, my style was focused on realism. I wanted to improve technique and hone my skills. So I practiced drawing exactly what I saw. My work consisted of still lifes. I loved working with graphite, because I had the control I needed as a young artist to capture the little fine details. Soon, I branched out when I discovered the power of colored pencils. It gave me the same control but also challenged me to not only get the correct values and details but also the right shade. Next, I started drawing nature. The flowers and birds I saw by my house were perfect practice. But art is not just about technique, it is also creativity.

          <p>
            After building a good foundation, I started to grow. I discovered ink and fell in love with charcoal. These mediums gave me a little less control, but also let me explore values and shadows. My favorite subject remains animals, but my imagination started to bleed into my art work more readily. I started using real objects as references for imaginary creatures. I incorporated chalk and pastel into my art, giving it a hazy dream-like feeling. I also discovered drawing “backwards” using black paper and white pencil.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would describe my style as detailed fantasy heavily influnced by the numerous countries I have traveled too. I believe realism and fantasy can be combined. I want to take my viewer on a journey that will spark their imagination and take them to other places. I focus on making the viewer believe the artwork feels realistic, even if it  never existed. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Nature and animals are my favorite subjects, and I am heavily inspired by them. I always loved going to the zoo and watching National Geographic documentaries. Animals have this raw, wild power that amazes me everytime I see them. These creatures thrive in the most dangerous environments, and even though we live on the same planet their lives differ so greatly from our own. I also take inspiration from the myths, legends and cultures of the places I have visited, especially the Greek Myths. This is where I found my love for fantasy. The tales of heros slaying mythical monsters ignited my imagination to create my own.
          </p> 
          <p>
            Art is the artist’s perception of the world, and it can reveal the artist's soul. Any work is art work. Even unfinished art has the potential to be transformed into something beautiful. My ultimate goal as an artist is to convey my perception of reality and to reveal my passion and imagery to viewers.
