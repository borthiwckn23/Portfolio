          <header><h2>My Intended Audience</h2></header>
          <p>I wanted this website to express my journey and growth as an artist. The website would have a clean and modern style that is easy to navigate but shows a creative flair that appeals to the esteem (confidence and reputation) and self-actualization (creativity and individuality) parts of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. The primary audience that I wanted to reach was potential employers looking to hire me as an artist. The website will make as much of an impression as my work itself (in web design the medium is the message after all). </p>

          <header><h2>My Research & Interviews</h2></header>
          <p>I interviewed two members of my target audience to learn more about how I should design my website. I found many similarities between the two people I interviewed. They both found a hard to read or cluttered navigation bar made a website very frustrating to use and it shows the important of a simple and evident design.</p>
          <p>However, there was a key difference between my interviewee’s views of the internet. For digital natives, those who are accustomed to the world wide web, things like navigating to pages and getting apps to work are effortless. But those who are not digital natives, they view the internet as more of a tool to utilize and gather data/information rather than a place to socialize, discover or explore. Because of this they only learn a few of the many features and uses of the internet. There are many Americans and potential members of my audience who either have limited knowledge of the internet.</p>
          <p>Knowing that only a small percentage of my audience is as computer savvy as the average college student, forces me to strip down my website to make it easier to understand for new users. I need to convey my passion for art and unique artistic vision without compromising accessibility. Based on the interviewee’s responses, I should design my website with a simple layout while letting the pictures of my artwork bring the creative flair.</p>
